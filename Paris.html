                        In general, Paris is great if you like big cities with lots of culture. It’s not for everyone. If you like beaches or mountains, Paris isn’t for you. If you like small towns or places where people speak English, Paris isn’t for you either, unless you don’t mind hopping on a train for an hour. (People speak English in Paris, but it won’t get you as far as French.)
                        <br><br>
                        But if you can get by in French, can afford to pay the roughly 2000 Euros a month that a 1-bedroom Airbnb costs, enjoy architecture and great fresh produce, and like the kinds of things that a big city has to offer (like arts and culture), then you might enjoy staying in Paris.
                        <br><br>
                        Our impression, in case you’re wondering — we loved our time in Paris. We ate well, we walked a lot, we loved being surrounded by beautiful architecture, and we enjoyed making and meeting friends. We’ll be back.
                        <br><br>
                        Every important sign in Paris is in English, announcements are in English, and pretty much everyone speaks defensible English, and of course young people/professionals speak it well.
                        <br><br>
                        You can even make friends in Paris just speaking English. There’s a big expat community, and many people living in France really just like hanging out with people from around Europe (and the world).
                        <br><br>
                        One thing important to me (and to some people) is multicultural food. I like Thai, Korean, Chinese, Japanese, Mexican, and other foods quite often. So I pick places to live that have some diversity.You can get multicultural food in Paris, but very often, they’re really sanitised. It’s not the fault of the owners; there’s a lot of societal pressure in Paris to conform. So while we found Korean restaurants and Chinese eateries, the food there was pretty bland (and expensive). This is a far cry from LA, Sydney, or other major multicultural cities where the diverse offerings are excellent.
